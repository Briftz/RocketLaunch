# RocketLaunch
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because unlike other rocket providers, SpaceX's Falcon 9 can recover the first stage. Sometimes the first stage does not land. Sometimes it will crash as shown in this clip. Other times, Space X will sacrifice the first stageâ€¯due to the mission parameters like payload, orbit, and customer.

Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.

Instead of using rocket science to determine if the first stage will land successfully, we will train a machine learning model and use public information to predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage in order to determine the price of each launch.
